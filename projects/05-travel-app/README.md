# Travel App Project

## Final project of the Udacity's Front End Nanodegree

### Overview
The project requires you to create a travel app with several API calls and a dynamic UI. In this project I've used geonames, weatherbit, pixabay, newsapi and ticketmaster.

### Workflow
* Build basic wireframe using miro app.
* Clone third Udacity's project as a starter code.
* First API calls with geonames, weatherbit and pixabay.
* More API calls for better travel information as news and upcoming shows.
* Update HTML and SCSS to add responsive layout.
* Install service workers.
* Test client and server side code with Jest.
* Hide API Keys with dotenv.

### Tools
* Visual Studio Code
